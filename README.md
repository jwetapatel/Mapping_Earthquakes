# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Overview of Project

 Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a  magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
 
 Using  knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.
 
 # Resources
 
 Leaflet.js library, Javascript, and HTML to retrieve earthquake information from a GeoJSON file and plot the results in a visual format.
